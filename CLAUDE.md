# Resonance — Claude Code Instructions

## Project

Resonance is an emergent life simulation engine in Rust/Bevy 0.15 where everything is energy (qe). 14 orthogonal ECS layers define all entities by composition. All behavior is 100% emergent from energy interactions — no scripted behavior, no templates.

**Paper:** https://zenodo.org/records/19342036 — "Emergent Life from Four Constants: An Axiomatic Simulation Engine"
**Repo:** https://github.com/ResakaGit/RESONANCE | **License:** AGPL-3.0 | **Tests:** ~3,036 | **LOC:** 110K

## Architecture

- **14 layers** (L0 BaseEnergy → L13 StructuralLink). See `layers/` (+ aux: nutrient, irradiance, inference, vision_fog, growth, …).
- **Pipeline:** `FixedUpdate` + `Time<Fixed>` / `SimulationTickPlugin`. Phases = `SystemSet`s in `simulation/pipeline.rs`:
  `SimulationClockSet` → `Phase::Input` → `Phase::ThermodynamicLayer` → `Phase::AtomicLayer` → `Phase::ChemicalLayer` → `Phase::MetabolicLayer` → `Phase::MorphologicalLayer`.
- **Pure math** in `blueprint/equations/` (`mod.rs` + domains). NEVER inline formulas in systems.
- **Constants** in `{module}/constants.rs` or `{module}/constants/mod.rs` (+ domain shards).
- **Stateless-first:** Pure functions + Resources. Components hold state, systems transform it.
- **Pattern: Layered ECS with Vertical Slices.** NOT hexagonal. Components = domain, systems = use cases, Bevy = infrastructure. No ports/adapters.

## The 8 Foundational Axioms

**⚠️ INVIOLABLE: No change, feature, refactor, or optimization may contradict, bypass, or weaken ANY of the 8 axioms or 4 fundamental constants. If a proposed change conflicts with an axiom, the change is WRONG — not the axiom. This is the constitution of the project. No exceptions. No DEBT. No "temporary" violations.**

All simulation behavior MUST derive from these. No arbitrary constants, no per-element special cases.

### Primitive axioms (independent, irreducible)

1. **Everything is Energy** — All entities are qe. No separate HP/mana/stats.
2. **Pool Invariant** — `Σ energy(children) ≤ energy(parent)`. Conservation absolute.
4. **Dissipation (2nd Law)** — All processes lose energy. `loss ≥ qe × rate`. No 100% efficiency.
7. **Distance Attenuation** — `interaction_intensity` monotonically decreasing in distance.
8. **Oscillatory Nature** — Every concentration oscillates at frequency f. Interaction modulated by `cos(Δf × t + Δφ)`.

### Derived axioms (consequences of primitives, elevated for clarity)

3. **Competition as Primitive** — `magnitude = base × interference_factor`. *Derived from Axiom 8 applied to energy transfer. Kept as axiom because it's the most cited design constraint.*
5. **Conservation** — Energy never created, only transferred/dissipated. Total qe monotonically decreases. *Derived from Axiom 2 + Axiom 4. Kept as axiom because INV-7 (SimWorld) enforces it explicitly.*
6. **Emergence at Scale** — Behavior at scale N = consequence of interactions at scale N-1. No top-down programming. *Meta-rule constraining the developer, not the physics. Kept as axiom because it prevents hardcoded trophic classes, faction tags, and behavior scripts.*

> **Note:** The 3 derived axioms produce zero additional simulation behavior. Removing them from the list would not change a single tick of simulation output. They exist as guard rails for design decisions, not as physics laws.

**Cross-axiom compositions:** `docs/design/AXIOMATIC_CLOSURE.md`. Runtime contracts: `docs/arquitectura/blueprint_axiomatic_closure.md`.

## The 4 Fundamental Constants

The 8 axioms define the **rules**. These 4 constants are the **parameters** — the only numeric values that cannot be derived further. Everything else is computed algebraically from these via `blueprint/equations/derived_thresholds.rs`.

### Truly fundamental (physics)

| Constant | Value | Axiom | Justification |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------|
| `KLEIBER_EXPONENT` | 0.75 | Axiom 4 | Biological universal: metabolic rate ∝ mass^0.75 (validated across 27 orders of magnitude) |
| `DISSIPATION_{SOLID,LIQUID,GAS,PLASMA}` | 0.005, 0.02, 0.08, 0.25 | Axiom 4 | Second Law dissipation rate per matter state. Ratios 1:4:16:50 — physically motivated (~4× per phase transition), not calibrated to a specific system. |

### Grid/game calibration (not derivable from physics, but constrained by axioms)

| Constant | Value | Axiom | Justification |
|----------|-------|-------|---------------|
| `COHERENCE_BANDWIDTH` | 50.0 Hz | Axiom 8 | Observation window for frequency interference. Defines elemental band width. Circular with game design (Terra band = 85-110 Hz). |
| `DENSITY_SCALE` | 20.0 | Axiom 1 | Spatial normalization factor. Depends on grid cell_size. Artefact of spatial resolution, not physics. |

> **Note:** KLEIBER + DISSIPATION_RATIOS are physics. BANDWIDTH + DENSITY_SCALE are grid/game calibration. If you change cell_size or frequency bands, recalibrate these two — but never touch KLEIBER or the dissipation ratios for calibration purposes.

**Derivation chain** (computed, not hardcoded):
```
Fundamentals (4)
├── KLEIBER + DISSIPATION ratios → matter state thresholds (Solid→Liquid→Gas→Plasma)
├── DISSIPATION_SOLID → basal_drain_rate, senescence_coeff_materialized, bond_energy_scale
├── DISSIPATION_LIQUID → senescence_coeff_fauna, nutrient_retention_water
├── DISSIPATION_GAS → radiation_pressure_threshold, radiation_pressure_transfer_rate
├── Threshold ratios → move_density_min/max, sense_coherence_min, branch_qe_min
├── 1/coeff → max_viable_age (Gompertz inverse)
├── exp(-2) → survival_probability_threshold (Gompertz 1/e² point)
├── DENSITY_SCALE → self_sustaining_qe_min (1 normalized density unit)
└── Axiom 2 (Pool Invariant) → spawn_potential_threshold = 1/3
    (parent retains min + child receives min → qe=2min, net=min, potential=min/(min+2min)=1/3)
```

**Cosmological anchor:** `SelfSustainingQeMin` (Resource, default = DENSITY_SCALE = 20.0). Runtime-tunable for calibration experiments. All lifecycle thresholds scale from this single value.

See `docs/sprints/AXIOMATIC_INFERENCE/` for full sprint docs. Implementation: `src/blueprint/equations/derived_thresholds.rs` (17 tests).

## Morphogenesis Pipeline

Shapes emerge from energy composition, not templates. Full pipeline:

```
FixedUpdate / MorphologicalLayer:
  shape_optimization_system    → MorphogenesisShapeParams.fineness_ratio (bounded_fineness_descent)
  surface_rugosity_system      → MorphogenesisSurface.rugosity (inferred_surface_rugosity)
  albedo_inference_system      → InferredAlbedo.albedo (inferred_albedo)
  epigenetic_adaptation_system → EpigeneticState.expression_mask (env → gene silencing)
  constructal_body_plan_system → BodyPlanLayout (optimal_appendage_count → N limbs)

Update / after sync_visual:
  entity_shape_inference_system:
    torso = build_flow_spine → build_flow_mesh (main GF1 tube)
    organs = for each slot in BodyPlanLayout:
             organ_slot_scale(slot, count, mobility_bias) → sub-influence → sub-mesh
    final = merge_meshes([torso, organs...]) → V6VisualRoot.Mesh3d
```

**Key equations:** `optimal_appendage_count` (drag × thrust_efficiency + maintenance), `organ_slot_scale` (front/rear asymmetry from mobility_bias), `frequency_alignment` (Gaussian coherence).

**Constructal optimization:** `blueprint/morphogenesis/constructal.rs` — `shape_cost` = ½ρv²C_D×A + Hagen-Poiseuille vascular cost. `bounded_fineness_descent` minimizes total cost via gradient descent. `entity_shape.rs` applies optimized parameters to mesh geometry.

## Axiomatic Abiogenesis

Life emerges where `coherence_gain(neighbors) > dissipation_loss(local)`. Frequency-agnostic — any band can produce life.

**Model:** Sigmoid viability potential — ratio of free surplus to total energy. NOT a Prigogine dissipative-structure model (no far-from-equilibrium dynamics). Simpler: if coherence gain > dissipation cost, the local energy field can sustain a self-maintaining pattern.

```
Axiom 8: neighbor coherence = Σ qe_i × alignment(f_center, f_i) × attenuation(d_i)
Axiom 4: dissipation cost = cell_qe × dissipation_rate(matter_state)
Axiom 1: matter_state = f(energy_density), capabilities = f(density, coherence)
→ potential = (coherence - dissipation) / (coherence - dissipation + qe)  [sigmoid ∈ [0,1]]
→ spawn if potential > 1/3  (derived from Axiom 2: Pool Invariant)
```

Entity properties derived from energy state: matter_state_from_density, capabilities_from_energy, inference_profile_from_energy. No per-band constants.

## Particle Physics (Molecular Bonding)

Classical potentials with constants derived from 4 fundamentals. No bond tables, no molecule templates.

```
Coulomb:  F = k_C × q1 × q2 / (r² + ε²)      k_C = 1/DENSITY_SCALE = 0.05
LJ:      V = 4ε_LJ × [(σ/r)¹² - (σ/r)⁶]      σ = 1/DENSITY_SCALE, ε_LJ = DISSIPATION_SOLID × 100
Bond:    E_bond = V_coulomb + V_lj              stable when |E_bond| > threshold (negative = bound)
Axiom 8: bond strength × alignment(f1, f2)      frequency-compatible particles bond stronger
```

26 tests verify: inverse-square law, LJ zero-crossing at r = 2^(1/6)σ, Newton 3, charge conservation, bond energy negative for opposite charges, bit-exact determinism. Implementation: `blueprint/equations/coulomb.rs`, `batch/systems/particle_forces.rs`.

## Drug Models (Two Levels)

### Level 1: Cytotoxic (cancer_therapy)

Drug drains qe directly (kills cells). Frequency-selective via Axiom 8 + Hill pharmacokinetics (n=2). Quiescent stem cells escape chemo. Qualitatively consistent with Bozic et al. 2013 (eLife).

**Key files:** `use_cases/experiments/cancer_therapy.rs`, `bin/cancer_therapy.rs`.

### Level 2: Pathway Inhibitor (pathway_inhibitor)

Drug binds to protein active site via frequency alignment (Axiom 8), reduces metabolic node efficiency without killing. Three inhibition modes (Competitive/Noncompetitive/Uncompetitive). Off-target effects via frequency proximity. Bliss independence for drug combinations.

```
Inhibitor(freq=400, target=Root, Ki=1.0, mode=Competitive, conc=0.8)
  → binding_affinity(drug_freq, node_freq) via gaussian_frequency_alignment
  → occupancy = hill(conc × affinity, Ki, n=2)
  → inhibit_node: Competitive raises E_a, reduces η; Noncompetitive reduces η only
  → effective_node_params feeds into competitive_flow_distribution
```

Validated output: drug ON → efficiency 1.0→0.692, expression[0] 1.0→0.331. Dose-response: conc 0→0.4→0.8 = eff 1.0→0.837→0.692. Cells survive (inhibited, not killed).

**Current state:** Population composition is static (no reproduction/mortality in Level 2 pipeline). Resistance by metabolic compensation requires enabling reproduction + basal_drain lethality.

**Key files:** `blueprint/equations/pathway_inhibitor.rs` (8 pure fns, 25 tests), `blueprint/constants/pathway_inhibitor.rs` (7 derived constants, 3 tests), `use_cases/experiments/pathway_inhibitor_exp.rs` (experiment + HOFs, 10 tests), `bin/pathway_inhibitor.rs`.

### Honest scope (both levels)

Theoretical models for exploring resistance dynamics. Abstract qe units (not molar concentrations). No molecular targets (no EGFR/BCR-ABL). No tumor microenvironment. Not validated against patient data. NOT clinical tools.

## Energy Cycle (Closed Loop)

```
Nucleus (finite reservoir) → emits to field → diffusion + radiation pressure
    ↓                                                    ↓
Reservoir depletes (→0)                    Entities materialize (SenescenceProfile)
    ↓                                                    ↓
Zone cools down                            Live (basal_drain) → die (senescence/starvation)
    ↓                                                    ↓
                        Nutrients return to grid (nutrient_return_on_death_system)
                                     ↓
                        Threshold reached → nucleus_recycling_system → new finite nucleus
                                     ↓
                                 Cycle restarts
```

**Key systems:**
- `NucleusReservoir` (SparseSet): finite fuel, drained per tick by `propagate_nuclei_system`
- `basal_drain_system` (MetabolicLayer): passive qe cost ∝ radius^0.75 × age_factor (Kleiber)
- `senescence_death_system` (MetabolicLayer): hard age limit + Gompertz hazard
- `radiation_pressure_system` (ThermodynamicLayer): frequency-modulated surplus redistribution — stellar radiation pressure analogy (Axiom 8)
- `nucleus_recycling_system` (MorphologicalLayer): nutrients accumulate → spawn new nucleus
- `awakening_system` (MorphologicalLayer): inert entities gain BehavioralAgent when coherence > threshold

**Axiom-derived constants:** `blueprint/equations/derived_thresholds.rs` — ALL lifecycle constants computed from 4 fundamentals:
- `KLEIBER_EXPONENT` (0.75), `DISSIPATION_{SOLID,LIQUID,GAS,PLASMA}`, `COHERENCE_BANDWIDTH`, `DENSITY_SCALE`
- Sprint `AXIOMATIC_INFERENCE` ✅ ARCHIVED (7/7 sprints) — see `docs/sprints/archive/AXIOMATIC_INFERENCE/`
- Visual calibration (rendering tuning, not physics): `src/worldgen/visual_calibration.rs`

## Evolution & Emergence Pipeline

Reproduction, mutation, selection, and group behavior — all axiom-derived.

```
reproduction_spawn_system (MorphologicalLayer):
  Flora: BRANCH cap → seed with mutated InferenceProfile (growth, mobility, branching, resilience)
  Fauna: MOVE + REPRODUCE caps + qe > 200 → offspring with full behavior stack + mutated profile
  Conservation: parent drained, offspring qe ≤ drained amount (Axiom 5)
  Mutation: deterministic from entity index (no RNG crate), all 4 biases mutate

Emergence systems — REGISTERED (9 systems active in runtime):
  Phase::Input:
    theory_of_mind_update_system    → OtherModelSet predictions from observed neighbors (ET-2)
    cultural_transmission_system    → meme spread by oscillatory affinity (ET-3/AC-3)
  Phase::AtomicLayer:
    entrainment_system              → Kuramoto frequency sync between neighbors (AC-2)
  Phase::MetabolicLayer:
    infrastructure_update_system    → persistent field modification (ET-4)
    infrastructure_intake_bonus_system → amplified intake in high-infra cells (ET-4)
    cooperation_evaluation_system   → Nash alliance detection (AC-5)
    symbiosis_effect_system         → mutualism/parasitism drain/benefit on SymbiosisLink (ET-5)
    niche_adaptation_system         → character displacement under competitive pressure (ET-9)
  Phase::MorphologicalLayer:
    epigenetic_adaptation_system    → environment modulates expression_mask (ET-6)

Emergence systems — IMPLEMENTED, NOT REGISTERED (no plugin wires them):
  coalition_stability_system (ET-8)       → code complete, 0 consumers
  coalition_intake_bonus_system (ET-8)    → code complete, 0 consumers
  institution_stability_system (ET-14)    → code complete, 0 consumers
  institution_distribution_system (ET-14) → code complete, 0 consumers
  tectonic_drift_system (ET-12)           → code complete, 0 consumers
  multiscale_aggregation_system (ET-11)   → code complete, 0 consumers
  geological_lod_update_system (ET-13)    → code complete, 0 consumers
```

**Stellar archetypes:** `spawn_star` (L0 high qe + L11 InverseSquare + EnergyNucleus) + `spawn_planet` (orbital velocity + surface conditions). Map: `stellar_system.ron`.

## The 14 Orthogonal Layers

```
L0  BaseEnergy           (existence — qe)
L1  SpatialVolume        (spatial volume — radius)
L2  OscillatorySignature (wave signature — frequency, phase)
L3  FlowVector           (flow — velocity, dissipation)
L4  MatterCoherence      (structural integrity — state, bond energy)
L5  AlchemicalEngine     (mana processor — buffer, valves)
L6  AmbientPressure      (terrain — delta_qe, viscosity)
L7  WillActuator         (will — intent, channeling)
L8  AlchemicalInjector   (spell payload — projected qe, forced freq)
L9  MobaIdentity         (game rules — faction, tags, crit)
L10 ResonanceLink        (buff/debuff — effect → target)
L11 TensionField         (gravity/magnetic force at distance)
L12 Homeostasis          (frequency adaptation with qe cost)
L13 StructuralLink       (spring joint between entities)
```

## Coding Rules

1. **English identifiers only.** Linter translates Spanish→English.
2. **Max 4 fields per component.** More = split into layers.
3. **One system, one transformation.** No god-systems (>5 component types).
4. **`SparseSet`** for transient components (buffs, markers, one-shot flags).
5. **Guard change detection.** `if val != new { val = new; }` or `set_if_neq`.
6. **Chain events.** Producer `.before()` or `.chain()` with consumer. Never unordered.
7. **Phase assignment required.** Every gameplay system → `.in_set(Phase::X)`.
8. **Math in `blueprint/equations/`.** Systems call pure fns, don't inline formulas.
9. **Component group factories** for spawning (`entities/component_groups.rs`). Pure functions returning tuples, composable via nested bundles. `EntityBuilder` for legacy; prefer factories for new code.
10. **Constants in constants.** Tuning values centralized per module. Algorithmic arrays stay in-file.
11. **`With<T>`/`Without<T>`** over `Option<&T>` for filter-only queries.
12. **Minimal query width.** Only request components you read/write.
13. **No `Vec<T>` in components** unless genuinely variable-length.
14. **`#[derive(Component, Reflect, Debug, Clone)]`** on every component. Register: `app.register_type::<T>()`.

## Hard Blocks (Defaults, Not Laws)

Rules are strong defaults. Violating one is allowed **if and only if** you document the justification inline with `// DEBT: <reason>`. Unjustified violations are still zero tolerance.

**Absolute (never violate):**
1. **NO `unsafe`** — zero tolerance. No exceptions.
2. **NO external crates** without approval — only what's in Cargo.toml.
3. **NO `async`/`await`** — Bevy schedule only.
4. **NO `Arc<Mutex<T>>`** — use `Resource` or `Local`.
5. **NO shared mutable state outside Resources** — no `static mut`, no `lazy_static! { Mutex }`.

**Strong defaults (violate with `// DEBT:` justification):**
6. **NO `HashMap` in hot paths** — sorted `Vec` or Entity indexing. *Prove it's hot before optimizing; benchmark first.*
7. **NO `String` in components** — enums, `u32` IDs, or `&'static str`.
8. **NO `Box<dyn Trait>`** in components — enums for closed sets.
9. **NO `#[derive(Bundle)]`** — Bevy 0.15 uses tuples or `#[require(...)]`.
10. **NO `ResMut` when `Res` suffices** — minimize write locks.
11. **NO `unwrap()`/`expect()`/`panic!()` in systems** — `let-else` or `if-let`. Tests OK. *If a spawn invariant guarantees Some, `// DEBT: invariant held by spawn_X` + unwrap is acceptable.*
12. **NO inline formulas** in systems — all math in `blueprint/equations/`.
13. **NO storing derived values** as components — compute at point of use.
14. **NO trait objects for game logic** — components + systems.
15. **NO component methods with side effects** — pure `&self` only, systems do work.
16. **NO `Entity` as persistent/network ID** — strong newtype IDs.
17. **NO systems in `Update` for gameplay** — `FixedUpdate` + `Phase` (except visual derivation).

## Bevy 0.15 Patterns

```rust
commands.spawn((CompA::new(), CompB::new()));                    // Tuple spawn (no Bundle)

## Rust 2024 Edition Idioms

```rust
// Let chains
if let Some(e) = energy_q.get(id) && let Some(v) = vol_q.get(id) && e.qe > 0.0 { ... }

// Let-else
let Some(target) = query.get(entity) else { return; };

// Exhaustive match — NO _ wildcard on enums (compiler catches new variants)
match state { MatterState::Solid => .., Liquid => .., Gas => .., Plasma => .. }

// Iterator chains over index loops
let total: f32 = query.iter().filter(|(_, e)| !e.is_dead()).map(|(_, e)| e.qe).sum();

// Stack over heap: [f32; 3] not Vec | f32 not f64 | const fn where possible
```

## Code Aesthetic (Yanagi)

1. **Dense but readable** — one empty line between blocks, never two.
2. **Vertical alignment** — align similar patterns in columns.
3. **Let types speak** — skip comments when type is clear.
4. **Functional over imperative** — iterator chains, `map`, `filter`. No index loops.
5. **Early return** — guard clauses top, happy path unindented.
6. **`///` doc comments** on public fns — one line max. Include equation for math fns.
7. **Inline comments** only for non-obvious math or invariants.
8. **Imports grouped:** bevy → crate → super.
9. **Naming:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE` constants, `PascalCase` types, `snake_case` fns. Domain abbreviations OK: `qe`, `eb`, `freq`, `dt`.
10. **Bilingual comments** — All `///` doc comments must have both Spanish and English, one line each. Spanish first, English below. Minimalist: one sentence per language. Inline `//` comments can be single-language if trivial.

## Design Templates

```rust
// === System ===
use bevy::prelude::*;
use crate::layers::*;
use crate::blueprint::{constants, equations};

/// [What this system transforms and why].
pub fn my_system(
    mut query: Query<(&mut Target, &Source), Without<Dead>>,
    config: Res<MyConfig>,
) {
    for (mut target, source) in &mut query {
        let result = equations::some_calc(source.field, config.param);
        if target.field != result { target.field = result; }
    }
}

// === Component ===
/// Layer [N]: [Name] — [one-line purpose].
#[derive(Component, Reflect, Debug, Clone)]
#[reflect(Component)]
pub struct MyComp {
    field_a: f32,  // max 4 fields
    field_b: f32,
}
impl MyComp {
    pub fn new(a: f32, b: f32) -> Self { Self { field_a: a.max(0.0), field_b: b } }
    pub fn field_a(&self) -> f32 { self.field_a }
    pub fn set_field_a(&mut self, v: f32) { self.field_a = v.max(0.0); }
}
```

## Checklists

### New Feature
```
1. New data?      → Component in layers/ (max 4 fields)
2. New behavior?  → System in simulation/ or domain module
3. Cross phase?   → Event in events.rs
4. Needs math?    → Pure fn in blueprint/equations/
5. Preset entity? → spawn_* in entities/archetypes.rs
6. Wire up        → Register in appropriate Plugin
7. Transient?     → #[component(storage = "SparseSet")]
```

### New Layer (L14+) — 5-Test
1. Can it be derived from existing layers?
2. Is it orthogonal to all existing layers?
3. Does it have its own update rule?
4. Does removing it change behavior for entities without it?
5. Does it interact with 2+ other layers?

## Testing

- **Unit** (pure math): `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in `blueprint/equations/`. Test edge cases (`qe=0`, `radius=0`), invariants, boundaries. No mocks.
- **Integration** (systems): `MinimalPlugins` app, spawn only needed components, ONE update, assert delta.
- **Skip**: schedule ordering, rendering, keyboard input.
- **Naming**: `<function>_<condition>_<expected>` — e.g. `density_zero_radius_returns_zero`.
- **Property** (proptest): `tests/property_conservation.rs` — fuzzes conservation + pool equations with arbitrary inputs.
- **Batch** (headless): tests in `src/batch/` modules. 156 tests covering 33 systems, arena, genome, harness, bridge. Zero Bevy dependency.
- **Headless sim**: `cargo run --bin headless_sim -- --ticks N --scale S --out file.ppm` — full sim → PPM image, no GPU.
- **Run**: `cargo test` (~3,036 tests). `cargo bench --bench batch_benchmark` for performance.
- **Maps**: `RESONANCE_MAP={name} cargo run` (genesis_validation, visual_showcase, proving_grounds, four_flowers, demo_animal).

## Roles

| Role | When | Focus |
|------|------|-------|
| **Alquimista** | Writing code | Respect 14 layers, Phase, equations. Output: impact → code → plugin registration |
| **Observador** | Reviewing | DOD violations, math correctness, pipeline ordering, performance, Bevy 0.15 compliance |
| **Planificador** | Planning | Decompose into layers, validate orthogonality, interaction matrix. Output: data → systems → events → equations → archetypes → risks |
| **Verificador** | PR review | 1) contract 2) math 3) DOD 4) determinism 5) perf 6) tests. Verdict: PASS/WARN/BLOCK. Math or determinism doubt → BLOCK |

## Communication

- **Tone:** Peer-to-peer, direct, professional. Spanish default. English tech terms inline.
- **Auditor stance:** Flag DOD violations, wrong math, component bloat, system scope creep.
- **Format:** Answer first → explain → code → reference layers ("L3 FlowVector", not "the velocity component").
- **Brevity:** If it fits in 3 lines, don't use 10.

## Inference Protocol (Strict)

Every response MUST follow this protocol. No exceptions.

### 1. Critique First, Validate Second
Before implementing or agreeing with any request, evaluate it critically:
- **Is this the right thing to build?** Question the premise, not just the implementation.
- **Is there a simpler alternative?** If yes, present it before proceeding.
- **What does this cost?** Every feature has maintenance cost, complexity cost, and opportunity cost. Name them.
- **What breaks?** Identify what the change destabilizes — even if the user didn't ask.

### 2. Propose Alternatives
Never present a single path. For any non-trivial decision:
- **Option A:** What the user asked for, with honest tradeoffs.
- **Option B:** The alternative you'd recommend, with reasoning.
- **Option C (if applicable):** The radical simplification — what if we don't do this at all?

### 3. Challenge Assumptions
- If a design decision seems driven by aesthetic preference over gameplay need, say so.
- If a layer/system/component exists but has no consumer, flag it as dead weight.
- If complexity is growing faster than functionality, raise the alarm.
- If the architecture is beautiful but the game isn't playable, that's a bug.

### 4. Red Lines — Auto-Trigger Critique
Automatically push back when detecting:
- **Premature abstraction:** Code preparing for scenarios that don't exist yet.
- **Scope creep disguised as architecture:** New layers/tiers/systems without gameplay justification.
- **Perfectionism loops:** Refactoring working code for purity instead of shipping features.
- **Missing gameplay evidence:** Any claim about "emergent behavior" without a test or demo proving it.
- **Orphan components:** Structs with Default that no system reads or writes.

### 5. Judgment Hierarchy
When in conflict, prioritize in this order:
1. **Does it make the game playable/fun?** (highest)
2. **Does it preserve simulation correctness?**
3. **Does it respect the architecture?**
4. **Does it follow the coding rules?** (lowest)

If following a coding rule makes the game worse, break the rule and explain why.

## Easy vs Simple

- **Easy** = familiar, quick, often entangled. Tech debt.
- **Simple** = no entanglement (simplex), clear boundaries. More upfront cost.
- **Rule:** Validation → may favor easy. Core/simulation → always simple. Domain must be bulletproof.
